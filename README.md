# 1 year K12 student success plan in sustainability development üå±

## Description
The "EMPower 1 year plan for student activities.docx" file presents an innovative lesson plan idea for the entire school year, offering a captivating and educational project for each of the eight months. These projects are carefully designed to engage students and provide hands-on learning experiences that encompass a wide range of subjects, from science and technology to art and sustainability. The goal of this lesson plan is to foster creativity, critical thinking, and collaboration among students. 

## Why ü§î
What makes this lesson plan truly unique is its openness and accessibility. We believe in the power of sharing knowledge and resources. Therefore, all project details, including code and materials, are made available on GitHub for anyone to access, use, and expand upon. This not only encourages educators to adopt and adapt these projects but also enables students, parents, and enthusiasts to explore, learn, and contribute to the projects. 

## Timeline üìÖ
Throughout the school year, students will embark on a journey of discovery and exploration, tackling projects that are not only exciting but also align with important educational objectives. By combining the joy of learning with the freedom to innovate, we hope to inspire a new generation of thinkers, problem-solvers, and creators. 

## Collaboration üë•
Join us in this educational adventure, and let's explore the endless possibilities of learning, making, and sharing. Together, we can empower students and educators to embrace the wonders of knowledge and creativity throughout the school year and beyond.

# Temperature Readings with Thermistor üå°Ô∏è

This Arduino code provides a basic temperature measurement setup using a thermistor. The code reads the analog output from the thermistor and calculates the temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit.

## Description
The code includes three variations of the temperature measurement:

1. **Serial Monitor Output (Fahrenheit):** The first part of the code outputs temperature readings in Fahrenheit to the Serial Monitor. It reads the analog value from the thermistor, calculates the temperature in Fahrenheit, and displays it.

2. **Serial Monitor Output (Celsius and Fahrenheit):** The second part of the code extends the first one by displaying the temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit. It reads the analog value from the thermistor, calculates the temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit, and displays both values in the Serial Monitor.

3. **LCD Display Output:** The third part of the code uses an LCD display to show temperature readings in Fahrenheit. It reads the analog value from the thermistor, calculates the temperature in Fahrenheit, and displays it on the LCD.

## Setup

### Components Needed
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Thermistor
- Resistor (R1)
- LCD Display (16x2 or similar)
- Breadboard and jumper wires

### Circuit Connection
- Connect the thermistor to an analog pin (e.g., A0) on the Arduino.
- Connect a resistor (R1) in series with the thermistor.
- Connect the other end of the resistor to ground (GND).
- Connect the junction between the thermistor and resistor to 5V.
- If using an LCD display, connect it according to the pins specified in the code.

## Usage

1. Upload the code to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
2. Open the Serial Monitor to see temperature readings (for the first two variations).
3. If you're using an LCD display, it will show the temperature readings in Fahrenheit.
4. The code includes a delay of 500 milliseconds between readings. You can adjust this delay as needed.


# Ultrasonic Sensor with LED Control

### Overview
This Arduino sketch is designed to work with an ultrasonic distance sensor and an LED. It measures the distance using the sensor and controls the LED based on the distance value.

### Components
- Arduino board
- Ultrasonic distance sensor (HC-SR04 or similar)
- LED
- Resistor (if needed for LED)
- Jumper wires

### Wiring
- Connect the trigPin (trigger pin) of the ultrasonic sensor to pin 10 on the Arduino.
- Connect the echoPin (echo pin) of the ultrasonic sensor to pin 13 on the Arduino.
- Connect the anode (longer leg) of the LED to pin 9 on the Arduino.
- Connect the cathode (shorter leg) of the LED to the ground (GND) of the Arduino, with a resistor in series if necessary.

### Functionality
- The code initializes the ultrasonic sensor, LED, and serial communication.
- It measures the distance using the ultrasonic sensor and calculates it in centimeters.
- If the distance is out of range (less than 2 cm or greater than 400 cm), it prints "Distance = Out of range" to the Serial Monitor.
- If the distance is within range, it prints the distance value in centimeters.
- The LED is controlled based on the distance:
  - If the distance exceeds 40 cm (as specified by `maxDistance`), the LED turns off.
  - If the distance is 40 cm or less, the LED turns on.

### Usage
1. Upload the code to your Arduino board.
2. Open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE to view distance measurements.
3. Observe the LED behavior:
   - It turns off when the distance exceeds 40 cm.
   - It turns on when the distance is 40 cm or less.

### Note
- Ensure proper wiring and component connections.
- Adjust `maxDistance` as needed to set the threshold distance for LED control.
